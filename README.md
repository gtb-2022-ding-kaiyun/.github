# All About Me

**Hello there, feel free to call me Kay or Karlene or K or anything you feel proper as long as it's related to the letter 'K' ;P**

_Let me briefly talked about the organization icon firstly:_

This is the final project I finished when I was approaching my minor degree of studio art, as a finance student.

We are assigned to:
> "finish a masterpiece within 4 days using two objects of your own choices"

So I chose skull and flower. 

Among all the drawings and paintings of mine, this is my fav of the fav. Simply, because I think it looks really **COOOOOOOOOL**

I barely do any selfies or portraiting due to the lack of confidence about my looks so...Unfortunately there might no be any pics of myself. Maybe next time till I overcome my appearance anxiety :/

Anyway, with great gratitude, I am way more than happy to be provided the offer by Thoughtworks and, with all the efforts I can put into, I would do my best to match such a hornor.

Good to meet y'all!
